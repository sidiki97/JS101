Implicit Type Conversion comparsion:

When a number is compared with a string using ==, the string is coerced into a number.
When a boolean is compared with any other value, it is coerced into a number and compared again using the == operator.
When an object is compared with a primitive value, the object is coerced into a primitive value and compared again using the == operator.
A == comparison of undefined with null evaluates as true.

**Note: always use Strict Equality Operator: ===
